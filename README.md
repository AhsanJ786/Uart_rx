# UART Receiver Project

This project implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) receiver using SystemVerilog. The project consists of three main modules: `baud_rate_gen`, `uart_receiver`, and `uart_system_top`.

## File Structure

- `baud_gen.sv`: Contains the baud rate generator module.
- `rx.sv`: Contains the UART receiver module.
- `top.sv`: Contains the top-level module that instantiates both the baud rate generator and the UART receiver.

## Module Descriptions

### 1. `baud_rate_gen.sv`

This module generates the baud rate tick signal used for timing the UART receiver.

#### Ports
- `clk`: System clock input.
- `rst`: Reset signal input.
- `dvsr`: Divisor for baud rate generation.
- `tick`: Output tick signal.

#### Functionality
The `baud_rate_gen` module divides the system clock based on the divisor value to generate a baud rate tick. It counts the clock cycles and generates a tick when the count reaches the divisor value.

### 2. `uart_receiver.sv`

This module implements the UART receiver logic.

#### Ports
- `clk`: Clock input.
- `rst`: Reset input.
- `serial_in`: Serial data input.
- `data_out`: Output data byte received.
- `byte_ready`: Indicates when a byte is ready to be read.

#### Functionality
The `uart_receiver` module receives serial data, detects the start bit, and samples the data bits. It assembles the received bits into a byte and outputs it when a complete byte has been received.

#### States
- `IDLE`: Waits for the start bit.
- `START_BIT`: Confirms the start bit.
- `RECEIVE`: Receives data bits.
- `STOP_BIT`: Receives the stop bit.

### 3. `uart_system_top.sv`

This is the top-level module that instantiates both the `baud_rate_gen` and `uart_receiver` modules.

#### Ports
- `clk`: System clock input.
- `rst`: System reset input.
- `serial_in`: Serial data input.
- `data_out`: Output data byte received.
- `byte_ready`: Indicates when a byte is ready to be read.
- `dvsr`: Divisor for baud rate generation.

#### Functionality
The `uart_system_top` module connects the baud rate generator and UART receiver. The tick signal generated by the baud rate generator drives the clock of the UART receiver.

## Usage

1. **Instantiate the Top Module**: Integrate the `uart_system_top` module in your design.
2. **Configure Baud Rate**: Set the `dvsr` value to configure the baud rate according to your requirements.
3. **Connect Serial Input**: Connect the `serial_in` port to the source of the serial data.
4. **Read Data**: Monitor the `byte_ready` signal to read the received byte from the `data_out` port.
